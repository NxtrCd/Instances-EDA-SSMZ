	     Instances for the EDA-SSMZ
--------------------------------------------------------

The set of instances is composed of five classes, where each class has the following information:

Class   WxH     Soil_samples
  1     6x7	    42	
  2     10x10	  100
  3	    15x10	  150	
  4	    15x15	  225
  5	    20x20	  400

WxH means the number of soil samples in the width and height of the agricultural field, respectively. 

The next figure shows an example for a parcel of 6x7, where the number 1 means the first soil sample, 
the number 21 is the last sample for the third row, and so on.

		              H
	  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
	  | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12| 13| 14| 
W	  | 15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20| 21| 
	  | 22| 23| 24| 25| 26| 27| 28|

	  | 36| 37| 38| 39| 40| 41| 42|

Each class contains ten instances where each file contains the corresponding information for each soil sample.
